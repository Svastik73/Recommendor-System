$${\color{red}The \collaborative\ filtering \learning\ algorithm\}$$

Apply it to a dataset of movie ratings. 
<h3>
The goal is to generate two vectors: 
1. For each user, a 'parameter vector' that includes the movie tastes of a user. 
2.For each movie, a feature vector of the same size which includes some description of the movie. 
 The dot product of the two vectors should produce an estimate of the rating the user might give to that movie
